# **Rainbow Linux** - The Linux Distribution For Everyone ðŸŒˆ
## Information About Rainbow Linux ðŸŒˆ
- Rainbow Linux is an **independent** Linux distribution that uses [Iris Package Manager](https://github.com/rainbow-linux/iris-pm) which is the package manager made by our team.
- It is aimed to be **out of the box** and **useful for everyone**, especially for people who would like to try Linux for the first time. 
- It is **easy to use**, you will be able to use [Rainbow Control Panel](https://github.com/rainbow-linux/rainbow-control-panel) to perform simple tasks, so you don't have to use terminal at all.
- It provides a profile called [Rainbow Gaming Mode](https://github.com/rainbow-linux/rainbow-gaming-mode) which installs gaming components and it uses [CachyOS Kernel](https://github.com/CachyOS/linux-cachyos), [Rainbow Gaming Utility](https://github.com/rainbow-linux/rainbow-gaming-utility) and many more configurations premade for the **best performance possible** while you're gaming.
